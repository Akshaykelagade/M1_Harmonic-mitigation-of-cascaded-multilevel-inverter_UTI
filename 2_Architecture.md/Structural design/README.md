# Component Description

## Multilevel Inverter
A multilevel inverter is a power electronic device that is capable of providing desired alternating voltage level at the output using multiple lower-level DC voltages as an input. Mostly a two-level inverter is used in order to generate the AC voltage from DC voltage.
## Driver
The Analog driver is responsible for providing an interface to Digital to Analog Converters (DACs) and Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs). 

## Pulse generation
A pulse generator is either an electronic circuit or a piece of electronic test equipment used to generate rectangular pulses. Pulse generators are used primarily for working with digital circuits, related function generators are used primarily for analog circuits.

## Logic Circuit
which helps in add, subtract, multiply, and divide binary numbers.

## Microcontroller
A microcontroller is embedded inside of a system to control a singular function in a device. It does this by interpreting data it receives from its I/O peripherals using its central processor.
